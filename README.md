This project was an effort of 4 group members to create a secure web application.

Features may not work as intended as the code has been modified for public repo. 
To combat plagarism, I will not be making the code neater and will not explain the functionalities in this readme. If you'd like to learn more or have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them via my discord. User: ko.l
